    "Ans: In Statistics, the probability distribution gives the possibility of each outcome of a random experiment or event. It provides the probabilities of different possible occurrences.To recall, the probability is a measure of uncertainty of various phenomena. Like, if you throw a dice, the possible outcomes of it, is defined by the probability. This distribution could be defined with any random experiments, whose outcome is not sure or could not be predicted.\n",
    "    Probability distribution yields the possible outcomes for any random event. It is also defined based on the underlying sample space as a set of possible outcomes of any random experiment. These settings could be a set of real numbers or a set of vectors or a set of any entities. It is a part of probability and statistics.\n",
    "    Random experiments are defined as the result of an experiment, whose outcome cannot be predicted. Suppose, if we toss a coin, we cannot predict, what outcome it will appear either it will come as Head or as Tail. The possible result of a random experiment is called an outcome. And the set of outcomes is called a sample point. With the help of these experiments or events, we can always create a probability pattern table in terms of variables and probabilities.\n",

    "Probability Distribution of Random Variables:\n",
    "    A random variable has a probability distribution, which defines the probability of its unknown values. Random variables can be discrete (not constant) or continuous or both. That means it takes any of a designated finite or countable list of values, provided with a probability mass function feature of the random variable’s probability distribution or can take any numerical value in an interval or set of intervals. Through a probability density function that is representative of the random variable’s probability distribution or it can be a combination of both discrete and continuous.\n",
