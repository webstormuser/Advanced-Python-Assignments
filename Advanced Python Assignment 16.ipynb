    "ANS :Regular Expressions, also known as “regex” or “regexp”, are used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. It means that we can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular expressions. I have used two terms, match and extract and both the terms have a slightly different meaning. There may be cases when we want to match a specific pattern but extract a subset of it. For example, we want to extract the names of PhD scholars from a list of names of people in an organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will match the “Dr XYZ” keyword and extract only the name, i.e. “XYZ” not the prefix “Dr.” from the list.  Regex is very useful in searching through large texts, emails, and documents. Regex is also called “programming language for the string matching”. Before diving into the regular expressions and their implementation in python, it is important to know their applications in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of regular expressions is form validation, i.e. email validation, password validation, phone number validation, and many other fields of the form.\n",

    "\n",
    "You must have noticed that every bank has an IFSC code for its different branches that starts with the name of the bank. The credit card number consists of 16 digits and the first few digits represent whether the card is Master, Visa, or Rupay. In all these cases, regex is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we forget the importance of regex in data mining? When the data is present in unstructured form, i.e. in text form, it needs to be converted to numbers to train the model. Therefore, regex plays an important role in analyzing the data, find patterns in the data, and finally performing operations on the dataset."
